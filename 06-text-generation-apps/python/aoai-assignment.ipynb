    "# Build text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen so far through this curriculum that there are core concepts like prompts and even a whole discipline called \"prompt engineering\". Many tools you can interact with like ChatGPT, Office 365, Microsoft Power Platform and more, support you using prompts to accomplish something.\n",
    "\n",
    "For you to add such an experience to an app, you need to understand concepts like prompts, completions and choose a library to work with. That's exactly what you'll learn in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn about the openai library and its core concepts.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Understand how to use concepts like prompt, temperature, and tokens to build a text generation app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what a text generation app is.\n",
    "- Build a text generation app using openai.\n",
    "- Configure your app to use more or less tokens and also change the temperature, for a varied output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally when you build an app it has some kind of interface like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Command-based. Console apps are typical apps where you type a command and it carries out a task. For example, `git` is a command-based app.\n",
    "- User interface (UI). Some apps have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) where you click buttons, input text, select options and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console and UI apps are limited\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare it to a command-based app where you type a command: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **It's limited**. You can't just type any command, only the ones that the app supports.\n",
    "- **Language specific**. Some apps support many languages, but by default the app is built for a specific language, even if you can add more language support. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of text generation apps\n",
    "\n",
    "So how is a text generation app different?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a text generation app, you have more flexibility, you're not limited to a set of commands or a specific input language. Instead, you can use natural language to interact with the app. Another benefit is that because you're already interacting with a data source that has been trained on a vast corpus of information, whereas a traditional app might be limited on what's in a database. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What can I build with a text generation app?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things you can build. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A chatbot**. A chatbot answering questions about topics, like your company and its products could be a good match.\n",
    "- **Helper**. LLMs are great at things like summarizing text, getting insights from text, producing text like resumes and more.\n",
    "- **Code assistant**. Depending on the language model you use, you can build a code assistant that helps you write code. For example, you can use a product like GitHub Copilot as well as ChatGPT to help you write code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can I get started?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you need to find a way to integrate with an LLM which usually entails the following two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use an API. Here you're constructing web requests with your prompt and get generated text back.\n",
    "- Use a library. Libraries help encapsulate the API calls and make them easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries/SDKs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few well known libraries for working with LLMs like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **openai**, this library makes it easy to connect to your model and send in prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are libraries that operate on a higher level like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Langchain**. Langchain is well known and supports Python.\n",
    "- **Semantic Kernel**. Semantic Kernel is a library by Microsoft supporting the languages C#, Python, and Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First app using openai\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can build our first app, what libraries we need, how much is required and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install openai\n",
    "\n",
    "  > [!NOTE] This step is not necessary if run this notebook on Codespaces or within a Devcontainer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many libraries out there for interacting with OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. It's possible to use numerous programming languages as well like C#, Python, JavaScript, Java and more.  \n",
    "We've chosen to use the `openai` Python library, so we'll use `pip` to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install openai\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't running this notebook in a Codespaces or a Dev Container, you also need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a resource\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you didn't already, you need to carry out the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an account on Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/free/>.\n",
    "- Gain access to Azure OpenAI. Go to <https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview#how-do-i-get-access-to-azure-openai> and request access.\n",
    "\n",
    "  > [!NOTE]\n",
    "  > At the time of writing, you need to apply for access to Azure OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an Azure OpenAI Service resource. See this guide for how to [create a resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal&WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Locate API key and endpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you need to tell your `openai` library what API key to use. To find your API key, go to \"Keys and Endpoint\" section of your Azure OpenAI resource and copy the \"Key 1\" value.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ![Keys and Endpoint resource blade in Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/media/quickstarts/endpoint.png?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have this information copied, let's instruct the libraries to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> It's worth separating your API key from your code. You can do so by using environment variables.\n",
    "> - Set the environment variable `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` to your API key in your .env file. If you already completed the previous exercises of this course, you are all set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup configuration Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Azure OpenAI, here's how you setup configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = AzureOpenAI(\n",
    "  api_key=os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY'],  \n",
    "  api_version = \"2023-10-01-preview\"\n",
    "  azure_endpoint = os.environ('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT')\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we're setting the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `api_key`, this is your API key found in the Azure Portal.\n",
    "- `api_version`, this is the version of the API you want to use. At the time of writing, the latest version is `2023-10-01-preview`.\n",
    "- `azure_endpoint`, this is the endpoint of the API. You can find it in the Azure Portal next to your API key. \n",
    "\n",
    "> [!NOTE]\n",
    "> `os.environ` is a function that reads environment variables. You can use it to read environment variables like `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generate text\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to generate text is to use the `chat.completion` class. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt = \"Complete the following: Once upon a time there was a\"\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we create a completion object and pass in the model we want to use and the prompt. Then we print the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat completions\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've seen how we've been using `Completion` to generate text. But there's another class called `ChatCompletion` that is more suited for chatbots. Here's an example of using it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = AzureOpenAI(\n",
    "  azure_endpoint = os.environ('AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT'), \n",
    "  api_key=os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY'],  \n",
    "  api_version = \"2023-05-15\"\n",
    "  )\n",
    "\n",
    "deployment = os.environ['AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT']\n",
    "\n",
    "completion = client.chat.completions.create(model=deployment, messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world\"}])\n",
    "print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "More on this functionality in a coming chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - your first text generation app\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we learned how to set up and configure Azure OpenAI service, it's time to build your first text generation app. To build your app, follow these steps:\n",

      "Once upon a time, there was a small village nestled between two towering mountains, where the sun painted the sky in brilliant shades of orange and purple each morning. This village, called Eldoria, was known for its lush green fields and sparkling streams. The villagers were a close-knit community, living in harmony with nature and celebrating the changing seasons with joy and laughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this village lived a curious girl named Lila. She had bright, sparkling eyes and a heart full of dreams that danced just beyond the horizon. Lila had a passion for adventure, always yearning to explore the mysteries of the world outside her village. Every evening, as the sun dipped below the mountains, she would sit by the edge of the forest, imagining the wonders that lay beyond the trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "One fateful day, while wandering deeper into the woods than she ever dared before, Lila stumbled upon a hidden glade bathed in a magical light. At the center of the glade stood an ancient tree, its trunk wide and gnarled, with branches that seemed to reach for the sky. As Lila approached, she noticed a soft, melodic hum resonating from the tree. Curious and enchanted, she placed her hand on the bark, and to her surprise, the tree began to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Welcome, dear child,” it said in a voice that sounded like rustling leaves. “I am the guardian of dreams, and I have watched over you for many moons. You possess a bravery I admire, but to truly understand the magic of this world, you must embark on a quest.”\n",
      "\n",

      "Without hesitating, Lila nodded. “I will!” \n",
      "\n",
      "And so, with a map marked by starlight and the promise of adventure, Lila began her quest, unaware of the challenges and wonders that awaited her beyond the mountains. The journey ahead would test her courage, friendship, and the very essence of what it meant to dream. The story of Lila was only just beginning, a tale woven with magic, discovery, and the true spirit of a heart unafraid to seek the extraordinary.\n"

      "### Concept: Creating a Class in Python\n",
      "A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of a class, and they can have their own data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Classes are used to organize code into reusable and modular structures, following the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). To define a class, you use the `class` keyword, and inside it, you can define attributes and methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Code: Implementing a Class\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Defining a class named 'Car'\n",
      "class Car:\n",
      "    # Constructor method to initialize object attributes\n",
      "    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n",
      "        self.brand = brand  # Instance attribute for brand\n",
      "        self.model = model  # Instance attribute for model\n",
      "        self.year = year    # Instance attribute for year\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Method to display car details\n",
      "    def display_info(self):\n",
      "        return f\"This is a {self.year} {self.brand} {self.model}.\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Method to simulate starting the car\n",
      "    def start_engine(self):\n",
      "        return f\"The {self.brand} {self.model}'s engine is now running!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "# Creating objects (instances) of the Car class\n",
      "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020)\n",
      "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2019)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Calling methods on the objects\n",
      "print(car1.display_info())\n",
      "print(car2.display_info())\n",
      "print(car1.start_engine())\n",
      "print(car2.start_engine())\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation of the Example\n",
      "1. **Class Definition**: \n",
      "   - The `class Car:` line defines a class named `Car`. This is the blueprint for creating car objects.\n",
      "   - Inside the class, we define methods and attributes that every `Car` object will have.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Constructor (`__init__` Method)**:\n",
      "   - The `__init__` method is a special method (also called a constructor) that gets called when a new object of the class is created.\n",
      "   - It takes `self` (which refers to the instance being created) and other parameters (`brand`, `model`, `year`) to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
      "   - Attributes like `self.brand`, `self.model`, and `self.year` store data specific to each instance of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Methods**:\n",
      "   - `display_info()` and `start_engine()` are methods defined inside the class. These are functions that belong to the class and can be called on any object of the class.\n",
      "   - They use `self` to access the instance's attributes (like `self.brand`) and return formatted strings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Creating Objects**:\n",
      "   - `car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2020)` creates an object of the `Car` class with the specified values for `brand`, `model`, and `year`.\n",
      "   - Similarly, `car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\", 2019)` creates another object with different values.\n",
      "   - Each object is independent and holds its own data.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calling Methods**:\n",
      "   - `car1.display_info()` calls the `display_info` method on the `car1` object, which returns a string with the car's details.\n",
      "   - Similarly, `car1.start_engine()` calls the `start_engine` method to simulate starting the car's engine.\n",
      "   - The same is done for `car2`, and since each object has its own data, the output reflects the specific details of each car.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Output**:\n",
      "   When you run the code, the output will be:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This is a 2020 Toyota Camry.\n",
      "   This is a 2019 Honda Civic.\n",
      "   The Toyota Camry's engine is now running!\n",
      "   The Honda Civic's engine is now running!\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   This shows how each object maintains its own state (data) and behavior (methods).\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How the Concept is Applied\n",
      "- Classes allow you to bundle related data and functionality together. In this example, the `Car` class encapsulates the properties of a car (like brand and model) and actions a car can perform (like starting the engine).\n",
      "- The `self` keyword is crucial as it refers to the specific instance of the class, ensuring that each object operates on its own data.\n",
      "- By creating multiple objects (`car1` and `car2`), you can see how a single class can be reused to represent different entities with unique data.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the essence of creating and using classes in Python, enabling modular and organized code for real-world modeling!\n"
